   - [ ] Add drill-down capabilities

## Context
With the historical data integration phase complete and significant progress on the portfolio input interface, we're now focusing on resolving test configuration issues and implementing form state persistence. Once these are complete, we'll move on to the Withdrawal Strategy Configuration phase. The portfolio interface improvements have enhanced user experience with advanced allocation options and better validation feedback.

## Next Steps

- ✓ Verify error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Fix Jest configuration for UI components
- [ ] Add visual regression tests

### Portfolio Configuration UI
- ✓ Enhance form state management
- ✓ Add advanced allocation options
- ✓ Implement tooltips and help text
- ✓ Add form validation feedback
- [ ] Implement form state persistence
- [ ] Fix client-side rendering issues

### Withdrawal Strategy UI
- [ ] Build strategy selection component
- [ ] Implement strategy configuration forms
- [ ] Add strategy comparison tools
- [ ] Create strategy visualization aids
- [ ] Implement strategy validation logic

### Results Visualization
- [ ] Set up Recharts integration
- [ ] Create interactive portfolio charts
- [ ] Implement success rate displays
- [ ] Build detailed results tables
- [ ] Add data export capabilities
