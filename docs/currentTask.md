# Current Task Status

## Recently Completed
- Added market metrics (P/E ratios and dividend yields) to database schema
- Created data loading script to populate historical data
- Implemented historical period comparison functionality
- Added API route for fetching historical metrics
- Updated frontend components to use the API

## Current Focus
Historical Analysis Tools - Data Visualization

### Requirements
1. Create visualization components for:
   - Market metrics over time (line charts)
   - Period comparison (bar charts)
   - Correlation analysis (scatter plots)
2. Implement interactive features:
   - Zoom and pan
   - Data point tooltips
   - Custom time range selection
3. Add responsive design for all chart components
4. Include proper loading states and error handling

### Technical Considerations
- Use a robust charting library (e.g., Recharts, Chart.js)
- Ensure proper TypeScript integration
- Implement client-side data transformation for efficient rendering
- Add proper accessibility features for charts

### Next Steps
1. Research and select appropriate charting library
2. Create base chart components
3. Implement data transformation utilities
4. Add interactive features
5. Style and polish visualizations

## Dependencies
- Historical data API endpoint (completed)
- Period comparison component (completed)
- Market metrics database schema (completed)

## Notes
- Focus on performance when handling large datasets
- Consider implementing data caching for frequently accessed periods
- Ensure charts are responsive across different screen sizes
