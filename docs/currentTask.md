   - ✓ Implement portfolio value input
   - ✓ Add asset allocation sliders
   - ✓ Implement input validation
   - [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage
   - [ ] Fix client-side rendering issues
   - [ ] Implement form state persistence

3. Withdrawal Strategy Configuration
   - [ ] Create strategy selection component
   - [ ] Implement fixed withdrawal inputs
   - [ ] Add percentage-based withdrawal options
   - [ ] Create inflation adjustment toggle
   - [ ] Add VPW implementation
   - [ ] Implement strategy comparison tools

4. Results Visualization
   - [ ] Implement portfolio balance chart
   - [ ] Add success rate visualization
   - [ ] Create yearly results table
   - [ ] Add export functionality
   - [ ] Implement confidence bands
   - [ ] Add drill-down capabilities

## Context
We have completed both the FRED API and Shiller dataset integrations, providing comprehensive historical data coverage from 1871 to present. The Shiller data is now properly processed and stored in the database, with automatic fallback to FRED data if needed. The next phase focuses on creating an intuitive user interface for configuring simulations and visualizing results. These tasks align with Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the project roadmap.

### Portfolio Configuration UI
- [ ] Enhance form state management
- [ ] Add advanced allocation options
- [ ] Implement tooltips and help text
- [ ] Add form validation feedback
- [ ] Create input history tracking

### Withdrawal Strategy UI
- [ ] Build strategy selection component
- [ ] Implement strategy configuration forms
- [ ] Add strategy comparison tools
- [ ] Create strategy visualization aids
- [ ] Implement strategy validation logic

### Results Visualization
- [ ] Set up Recharts integration
- [ ] Create interactive portfolio charts
- [ ] Implement success rate displays
- [ ] Build detailed results tables
- [ ] Add data export capabilities
