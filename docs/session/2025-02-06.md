# Session Summary - February 6, 2025

## Completed Tasks

### Portfolio Input Interface Enhancements
1. Added advanced allocation options:
   - Implemented rebalancing frequency selection
   - Added threshold-based rebalancing with configurable thresholds
   - Added portfolio drift tracking toggle
2. Enhanced form validation:
   - Added validation for rebalancing thresholds
   - Improved error messaging and feedback
3. Improved accessibility:
   - Added ARIA labels and roles
   - Implemented tooltips for better user guidance
4. Added comprehensive test coverage:
   - Unit tests for form initialization
   - Tests for form state management
   - Validation testing
   - Form submission testing

### Technical Improvements
1. Enhanced type safety:
   - Updated PortfolioConfig and PortfolioFormData types
   - Added RebalancingFrequency type
   - Added RebalancingThresholds interface
2. Improved component organization:
   - Modular form sections
   - Clear separation of concerns
3. Added test infrastructure:
   - Set up UI component mocks
   - Configured Jest for UI testing

## Progress on Project Roadmap
- ✓ Advanced allocation options under Portfolio Management
- ✓ Form validation feedback
- ✓ Tooltips and help text
- ✓ Test coverage for portfolio components

## Next Steps
1. Fix client-side rendering issues
2. Implement form state persistence
3. Begin work on Withdrawal Strategy Configuration

## Technical Notes
- Need to improve test setup for UI components
- Consider adding visual regression tests
- May need to optimize form re-rendering

## Dependencies Updated
- Added @radix-ui/react-tooltip
- Updated test configuration for UI components

## Documentation Updates
- Updated currentTask.md to reflect progress
- Added tooltips documentation
- Enhanced testing documentation

## Code Quality
- All TypeScript strict mode checks passing
- Maintained consistent naming conventions
- Followed accessibility guidelines
- Implemented proper error handling

## Open Issues
1. Jest configuration needs refinement for UI component testing
2. Consider adding performance tests for form interactions
3. May need to optimize form validation feedback

## Next Session Goals
1. Fix test configuration issues
2. Complete form state persistence implementation
3. Begin withdrawal strategy component development
