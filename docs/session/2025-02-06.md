## Afternoon Session (2:15 PM EST)
### Phase: Data Integration Planning
#### Focus: Shiller Data Integration

### Summary
1. Added Shiller data integration to project roadmap
2. Created detailed technical specification
3. Updated implementation plan to use existing data files

### Files Modified
1. `/docs/projectRoadmap.md`
   - Added Enhanced Historical Data Integration section
   - Updated Phase 2 milestones

2. `/docs/features/shillerDataIntegration.md`
   - Created new technical specification
   - Documented data sources and implementation plan
   - Updated to reflect existing data files

### Decisions
1. Will use existing Shiller data files from `/data` folder initially
2. Automated data fetching moved to future enhancement
3. Will integrate with current FRED data for comprehensive coverage

### Next Steps
1. Begin implementing data processing for Shiller data files
2. Create data validation and reconciliation logic
3. Update database schema to support combined dataset

### Outstanding Questions
1. Need to verify format and completeness of existing data files
2. Need to determine exact mapping between Shiller and FRED data fields
3. Consider performance implications of expanded historical dataset

## Session Review
