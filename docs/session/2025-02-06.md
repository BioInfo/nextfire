## Completed Work

### Historical Analysis Feature Implementation
- Added market metrics (P/E ratios and dividend yields) to database schema
- Created data loading script to populate historical data from Shiller dataset
- Implemented historical period comparison functionality
- Added API route for fetching historical metrics
- Updated frontend components to use the API instead of direct database access

### Database Changes

### Architecture Improvements

- Added proper TypeScript types for all new functionality

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining Historical Analysis Tools:
   - Add data visualization components
   - Implement anomaly detection
   - Add trend analysis features
2. Begin work on Monte Carlo Projections feature

## Technical Debt & Improvements
- Consider adding caching for historical metrics API
- Add error boundaries for better error handling
- Consider adding loading states for metrics fetching
