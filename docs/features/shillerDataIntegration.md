# Shiller Data Integration Plan

## Overview
Integration of Robert Shiller's historical market data from Yale to enhance our historical simulations with data going back to 1871. This will be combined with our existing FRED data to provide the most comprehensive and accurate historical market analysis possible.

## Data Sources

### 1. Shiller Data (Yale)
- **Source Files**: 
  - `/data/ie_data.xls`
  - `/data/ie_data.csv`
- **Coverage**: 1871-present
- **Key Metrics**:
  - S&P 500 prices and dividends
  - Long-term interest rates
  - Consumer Price Index (CPI)
  - Earnings data
  - CAPE ratio (Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings)

### 2. FRED Data (Current)
- **Coverage**: 1947-present
- **Key Metrics**:
  - S&P 500 Index
  - Consumer Price Index
  - 10-Year Treasury Rate

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Data Processing
1. Process Existing Data Files
   - Parse existing XLS/CSV files from `/data` folder
   - Create standardized data structures
   - Document data format and column mappings

2. Data Validation
   - Cross-reference overlapping periods with FRED data
   - Identify and handle discrepancies
   - Document methodology for reconciliation

### Future Enhancement: Automated Data Collection
1. Create a Shiller data fetcher
   - Implement automated download from Yale website
   - Set up periodic data updates
   - Version control for data files

### Phase 2: Data Processing
1. Data Normalization
   - Convert all values to consistent units
   - Adjust for inflation across the entire period
   - Handle currency denomination changes

2. Return Calculations
   - Calculate total returns including dividends
   - Compute real returns using CPI data
   - Generate rolling period statistics

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Database Schema Updates
   - Add source tracking for data points
   - Include confidence scores for different periods
   - Store metadata about data reconciliation

2. API Layer Updates
   - Modify endpoints to use combined dataset
   - Add parameters for data source selection
   - Include data provenance in responses

## Technical Considerations

### Data Quality
- Implement anomaly detection for data points
- Handle missing or incomplete data
- Document assumptions and methodologies
- Version control for data processing logic

### Performance
- Optimize data storage for quick retrieval
- Cache commonly requested periods
- Implement efficient data merging strategies

### Validation
- Cross-reference with other historical sources
- Document discrepancies and adjustments
- Regular data quality audits
